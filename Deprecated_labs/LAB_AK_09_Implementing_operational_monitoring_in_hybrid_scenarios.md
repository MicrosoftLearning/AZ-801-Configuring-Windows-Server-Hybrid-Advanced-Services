# Lab answer key: Implementing operational monitoring in hybrid scenarios

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Implementing%20operational%20monitoring%20in%20hybrid%20scenarios)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Exercise 1: Preparing a monitoring environment

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine

1. Connect to **SEA-SVR2**, and if needed, sign in as **CONTOSO\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. On **SEA-SVR2**, start Microsoft Edge, go to the Azure portal at `https://portal.azure.com/`, and sign in by using the credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you'll be using in this lab.
1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, open the Azure Cloud Shell pane by selecting the Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

   > **Note:** If this is the first time you're starting Cloud Shell and you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, select the **Upload/Download files** icon, in the drop-down menu select **Upload**, and upload the file **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab09\\L09-rg_template.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. Repeat the previous step to upload the **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab09\\L09-rg_template.parameters.json** file into the Cloud Shell home directory.
1. To create the resource group that will be hosting the lab environment, in the **PowerShell** session in the Cloud Shell pane, enter the following commands, and after entering each command, press Enter (replace the `<Azure_region>` placeholder with the name of an Azure region where you intend to deploy resources in this lab):

   >**Note**: You can use the **(Get-AzLocation).Location** command to list the names of available Azure regions:

   ```powershell 
   $location = '<Azure_region>'
   $rgName = 'AZ801-L0901-RG'
   New-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location
   ```

1. To deploy an Azure virtual machine (VM) into the newly created resource group, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell 
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Name az801l0901deployment -ResourceGroupName $rgName -TemplateFile ./L09-rg_template.json -TemplateParameterFile ./L09-rg_template.parameters.json -AsJob
   ```

   >**Note**: Do not wait for the deployment to complete but instead proceed to the next task. The deployment should take about 3 minutes.

#### Task 2: Register the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers

1. To register the Microsoft.Insights and Microsoft.AlertsManagement resource providers, on **SEA-SVR2**, from the Cloud Shell pane, enter the following commands, and after entering each command, press Enter.

   ```powershell
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Insights
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AlertsManagement
   ```

   >**Note**: To verify the registration status, you can use the **Get-AzResourceProvider** cmdlet.

   >**Note**: Do not wait for the registration process to complete but instead proceed to the next task. The registration should take about 3 minutes.

1. Close Cloud Shell.

   ```powershell
   $vCpuCount = Get-WmiObject Win32_Processor | Select-Object -ExpandProperty NumberOfLogicalProcessors
   ForEach ($vCpu in 1..$vCpuCount){ 
      Start-Job -ScriptBlock{
         $result = 1;
         ForEach ($loopCount in 1..2147483647){
            $result = $result * $loopCount
         }
      }
   }
   ```
   >**Note**: When you press **"T"** to enter the PowerShell commands, the code automatically inserts three additional curly braces. This will cause the script to fail so make sure you remove the three additional braces before you select **Run**.

   >**Note**: This should increase the CPU utilization above the threshold of the newly created alert rule.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, open another tab, browse to the **Monitor** page, and then select **Alerts**.
