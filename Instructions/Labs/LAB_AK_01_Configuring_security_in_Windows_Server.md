# Lab answer key: Configuring security in Windows Server

>**Note**: The lab simulations that were previously provided have been retired.

## Exercise 1: Configuring Windows Defender Credential Guard

> **Note**: In the lab environment, Credential Guard will not be available on VMs because they don't meet the prerequisites. This, however, will not prevent you from stepping through the process of implementing it by using Group Policy and evaluating its readiness by using corresponding tools.

#### Task 1: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using Group Policy

1. Connect to **SEA-SVR2** and, if needed, sign in with the credentials provided by the instructor.
1. In the **Type here to search** text box next to the **Start** button, enter **Group Policy Management**.
1. In the list of results, select **Group Policy Management**.
1. In the **Group Policy Management** console, expand **Forest: contoso.com**, expand **Domains**, expand **contoso.com**, right-click or access the **context** menu for the **IT** Organizational Unit (OU), and then select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here**.
1. In the **New GPO** dialog box, in the **Name** text box, enter **CredentialGuard_GPO**, and then select **OK**.
1. In the **Group Policy Management** window, under **IT**, right-click or access the **context** menu for **CredentialGuard_GPO**, and then select **Edit**.
1. In the **Group Policy Management Editor**, browse to **Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Device Guard**.
1. Select **Turn On Virtualization Based Security**, and then select the **policy setting** link.
1. In the **Turn On Virtualization Based Security** window, select the **Enabled** option.
1. In the **Select Platform Security Level** drop-down list, ensure that the **Secure Boot and DMA Protection** entry is selected.
1. In the **Credential Guard Configuration** drop-down list, select the **Enabled with UEFI lock** entry.
1. In the **Secure Launch Configuration** drop-down list, select the **Enabled** entry, and then select **OK**.
1. Close the **Group Policy Management Editor** window.
1. Close the **Group Policy Management** console window.

#### Task 2: Enable Windows Defender Credential Guard using the Hypervisor-Protected Code Integrity (HVCI) and Windows Defender Credential Guard hardware readiness tool

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, select **Start**, right-click or access the **context** menu for **Windows PowerShell**, and then select **Run as administrator**.
1. To run the HVCI and Windows Defender Credential Guard hardware readiness tool, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following commands, select **[R] Run once** at the first prompt, and then press Enter for the rest of the prompts:

   ```powershell
   Set-Location -Path C:\Labfiles\Lab01\
   .\DG_Readiness_Tool.ps1 -Enable -AutoReboot
   ```

1. Wait until the tool completes its run and, when prompted, in the **You're about to be signed out** dialog box, select **Close**.

   > **Note**: The operating system will restart. 

1. Once the restart completes, sign back into **SEA-SVR2** with the credentials provided by the instructor.

## Exercise 2: Locating problematic accounts

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true}
   ```

1. Review the list of user accounts returned.
1. To enable password expiration for all user accounts in the result set, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true -and PasswordNeverExpires -eq $true} | Set-ADUser -PasswordNeverExpires $false
   ```

1. To verify the outcome, rerun the command from step 2 and notice that no results are returned.

#### Task 2: Locate and disable domain accounts that have not been used to sign in for at least 90 days

1. To identify Active Directory user accounts that have not been used to sign in for at least 90 days, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   $days = (Get-Date).AddDays(-90)
   Get-ADUser -Filter {LastLogonTimeStamp -lt $days -and enabled -eq $true} -Properties LastLogonTimeStamp
   ```

   > **Note**: In the lab environment, no results will be returned.

1. To disable Active Directory user accounts that have not been used to sign in for at least 90 days, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Filter {LastLogonTimeStamp -lt $days -and enabled -eq $true} -Properties LastLogonTimeStamp | Disable-ADAccount
   ```

   > **Note**: In the lab environment, no results will be returned.
