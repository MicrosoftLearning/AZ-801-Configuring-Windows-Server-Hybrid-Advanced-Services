   >**Note**: Wait for the installation to complete. This might take about 5 minutes.

## Exercise 2: Configuring Microsoft Defender for Cloud

### Scenario

Next, you need to make sure you will be able take advantage of the enhanced security features offered by Defender for Cloud. This will allow you to properly evaluate the features and capabilities that apply to Windows Server hybrid scenarios.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Enable Defender for Cloud and automatic agent installation.
1. Enable enhanced security of Defender for Cloud.

#### Task 1: Enable Defender for Cloud and automatic agent installation

In this task, you will connect to your Azure subscription and enable enhanced security features of Defender for Cloud.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the Azure portal, browse to the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** page.
1. Upgrade your subscription to Defender for Cloud and enable automatic agent installation. 

   > **Note:** Your subscription may already have the enhanced security of Defender for Cloud enabled, in which case, continue to the next task.

#### Task 2: Enable enhanced security of Defender for Cloud

In this task, you will enable enhanced security of Defender for Cloud.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, from the **Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Overview** page, browse to the **Environment settings** page.
1. On the **Environment settings** page, review the Defender for Cloud plans available in your Azure subscription.

   > **Note:** Note that you can selectively disable individual Microsoft Defender plans listed on the same page.

1. Enable the **Microsoft Defender for Servers** plan. 
1. Browse to the **Settings \| Auto provisioning** page. 
1. In the list of extensions, perform the following tasks:

   - Enable **Log Analytics agent for Azure VMs** leveraging the Log Analytics workspace you created in the previous exercise.
   - Enable **Log Analytics agent for Azure Arc Machine (preview)** leveraging the Log Analytics workspace you created in the previous exercise.
   - Enable **Vulnerability assessment for machines** with the **Microsoft threat and vulnerability management** option.

   > **Note:** To enable all Defender for Cloud features including threat protection capabilities, you must enable enhanced security features on the subscription containing the applicable workloads. Enabling it at the workspace level doesn't enable just-in-time VM access, adaptive application controls, and network detections for Azure resources. In addition, the only Microsoft Defender plans available at the workspace level are Microsoft Defender for servers and Microsoft Defender for SQL servers on machines.

1. For the workspace you created in the previous exercise, set the scope of **Data collection** to **All Events**.

   > **Note:** Selecting a data collection tier in Defender for Cloud only affects the storage of security events in your Log Analytics workspace. The Log Analytics agent will still collect and analyze the security events required for Defender for Cloud's threat protection, regardless of the level of security events you choose to store in your workspace. Choosing to store security events enables investigation, search, and auditing of those events in your workspace.

## Exercise 3: Provisioning Azure VMs running Windows Server
