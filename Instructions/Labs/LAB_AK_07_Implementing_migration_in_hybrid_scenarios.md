# Lab answer key: Migrating Hyper-V VMs to Azure by using Azure Migrate

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Migrating%20Hyper-V%20VMs%20to%20Azure%20by%20using%20Azure%20Migrate)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

**Note**: You may need to install the latest version of the Microsoft Edge browser. To update the Microsoft Edge browser, select the three dots (ellipsis) icon in the upper-right corner of the window. Select **Help and feedback** from the dropdown menu, then select **About Microsoft Edge**. Edge will automatically check for updates and download any available updates, once the update is downloaded, click on the **Restart**

## Exercise 1: Prepare the lab environment

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template

1. Connect to **SEA-SVR2** and then, if needed, sign in with the credentials provided by the instructor.
1. On **SEA-SVR2**, start Microsoft Edge, go to the **[301-nested-vms-in-virtual-network Azure QuickStart template](https://github.com/az140mp/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/demos/nested-vms-in-virtual-network)** and select **Deploy to Azure**. (You'll find the button **Deploy to Azure** in the `README.md` file after the list of resources created by the template.) This will automatically redirect the browser to the **Hyper-V Host Virtual Machine with nested VMs** page in the Azure portal.
1. When prompted, in the Azure portal, sign in by using the credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you'll be using in this lab.
1. On the **Hyper-V Host Virtual Machine with nested VMs** page in the Azure portal, specify the following settings (Leave others with their default values.):

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
   | Resource group | the name of a new resource group **AZ801-L0701-RG** |
   | Region | the name of an Azure region into which you can provision Azure VMs |
   | Virtual Network Name | **az801l07a-hv-vnet** |
   | Host Network Interface1Name | **az801l07a-hv-vm-nic1** |
   | Host Network Interface2Name | **az801l07a-hv-vm-nic2** |
   | Host Virtual Machine Name | **az801l07a-hv-vm** |
   | Host Admin Username | **Student** |
   | Host Admin Password | **Pa55w.rd1234** |

1. On the **Hyper-V Host Virtual Machine with nested VMs** page, select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment might take about 10 minutes.

#### Task 2: Provide remote access

**Note**: We always recommend the use of Bastion Host to access sensitive VMs such as the one deployed, for the most secure and robust features, but for demonstration porpuses of this lab, we will be configuring direct remote access.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, start Microsoft Edge and browse **[whatismyipaddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)**. Save the ip adrress in a notepad, it will be used in a later step.
1. In the Azure portal, click on the **Cloud Shell** icon, located directly to the right of the search textbox at the top of the page.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**.

   >**Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and select **Create storage**.

1. From the **Bash** prompt, in the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to create a new public ip address:

   ```bash
      az network public-ip create --name RDP --resource-group AZ801-L0701-RG
      ```
1. Run the following command to link the new public ip address to the network interface nic1 of the VM:
   ```bash
      az network nic ip-config update \
      --name ipconfig \
      --nic-name az801l07a-hv-vm-nic1 \
      --resource-group AZ801-L0701-RG \
      --public-ip-address RDP
   ```
1. Run the following command to create a new nsg rule, to allow remote access from **SEA-SVR2**. Replace the placeholder **WHATS-MY-IP-ADDRESS** with the ip address saved in the previous step:
   ```bash
      az network nsg rule create \
      --name RDP \
      --nsg-name NATNSG \
      --priority 100 \
      --resource-group AZ801-L0701-RG \
      --access Allow \
      --description "RDPIn" \
      --destination-port-ranges 3389 \
      --direction Inbound \
      --protocol TCP \
      --source-address-prefixes WHATS-MY-IP-ADDRESS/32

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

   > **Note:** If this is the first time you're starting **Cloud Shell** and you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following command to list all the resource groups you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ801-L070*'
   ```

   > **Note**: Verify that the output contains only the resource group you created in this lab. This group will be deleted in this task.

1. From the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following to delete the resource group you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ801-L070*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

   > **Note:** The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *-AsJob* parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately after within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
