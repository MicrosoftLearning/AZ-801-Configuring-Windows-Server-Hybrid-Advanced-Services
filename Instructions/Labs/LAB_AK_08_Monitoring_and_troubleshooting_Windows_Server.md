# Lab answer key: Monitoring and troubleshooting Windows Server

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Monitoring%20and%20troubleshooting%20Windows%20Server)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

### Exercise 1: Establishing a performance baseline

> **Note**: After starting the Data Collector Set, there might be a delay of 10 minutes for the results to appear.

#### Task 1: Create and start a data collector set

1. Connect to **SEA-SVR2**, and then, if needed, sign in with the credentials provided by the instructor.
1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the **Type here to search** text box next to the **Start** button, enter **Perf**, and then, in the **Best match** list, select **Performance Monitor**.
1. In Performance Monitor, expand the **Data Collector Sets** node in the navigation pane, and then select **User Defined**.
1. Right-click or access the context menu for **User Defined**, select **New**, and then select **Data Collector Set**. This will launch the **Create new Data Collector Set** wizard.
1. On the **How would you like to create this new data collector set?** page of the **Create new Data Collector Set** wizard, enter **SEA-SVR2 Performance** in the **Name** box.
1. Select the **Create manually (Advanced)** option, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **What type of data do you want to include?** page, select the **Performance counter** checkbox, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Which performance counters would you like to log?** page, select **Add**.
1. In the **Available counters** list, expand **Processor**, select **% Processor Time**, ensure that the **_Total** entry is selected in the **Instances of selected object** section, and then select **Add**.
1. In the **Available counters** list, expand **Memory**, select **Pages/sec**, and then select **Add**.
1. In the **Available counters** list, expand **PhysicalDisk**, select **% Disk Time**, ensure that the **_Total** entry is selected in the **Instances of selected object** section, and then select **Add**.
1. Select **Avg. Disk Queue Length**, ensure that the **_Total** entry is selected in the **Instances of selected object** section, and then select **Add**.
1. In the **Available counters** list, expand **System**, select **Processor Queue Length**, and then select **Add**.
1. In the **Available counters** list, expand **Network Interface**, select **Bytes Total/sec**, ensure that the **<All instances>** entry is selected in the **Instances of selected object** section, select **Add**, and then select **OK**.
1. On the **Which performance counters would you like to log?** page, enter **1** in the **Sample interval** box, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Where would you like the data to be saved?** page, select **Next**.
1. On the **Create the data collector set?** page, ensure that the **Save and close** option is selected, and then select **Finish**.
1. In Performance Monitor, in the results pane, right-click or access the context menu for **SEA-SVR2 Performance**, and then select **Start**.

#### Task 2: Create a typical workload on the server

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, select **Start**, right-click or access the context menu for Windows PowerShell, and then select **Run as administrator**.
1. To create a file of a specific size, at the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   fsutil file createnew bigfile 104857600
   ```

1. To copy the newly created file to the root of drive **C** of **SEA-DC1**, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path .\bigfile -Destination \\SEA-DC1.contoso.com\c$\ -Force
   ```

1. To copy the file from the root of drive **C** of **SEA-DC1** to the current working directory, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path \\SEA-DC1.contoso.com\c$\bigfile -Destination .\bigfile2 -Force
   ```

1. To delete both files in the current working directory, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path .\bigfile* -Force
   ```

1. To delete the file in the root of drive **C** of **SEA-DC1**, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Path \\SEA-DC1.contoso.com\c$\bigfile -Force
   ```

1. Leave the Windows PowerShell window open.

#### Task 3: Analyze the collected data

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, switch to Performance Monitor.
