1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the Microsoft Edge displaying the Azure portal, browse to the **az801l05a-rsvault | Replicated items** page, and select the **SEA-CORE1** entry.
1. On the **SEA-CORE1** replicated items page, select the ellipsis in the toolbar, and from the drop-down menu, select **Disable replication**. 
1. On the **Disable replication** page, ensure that the **Disable replication and remove (Recommended)** entry appears in the **Remove replicated items** drop-down list, select **I don't want to provide feedback** checkbox, and then select **OK**.

#### Task 2: Delete the lab resource groups

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the Microsoft Edge window displaying the Azure portal, open the Azure Cloud Shell pane by selecting the Cloud Shell button in the Azure portal.
1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**.

   > **Note:** If this is the first time you're starting Cloud Shell and you're presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to list all resource groups you created in this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ801-L050*'
   ```

   > **Note**: Verify that the output contains only the resource group you created in this lab. This group will be deleted in this task.

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to delete all resource groups created throughout this lab:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup -Name 'AZ801-L050*' | Remove-AzResourceGroup -Force -AsJob
   ```

   > **Note:** The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the *-AsJob* parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately after within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.
