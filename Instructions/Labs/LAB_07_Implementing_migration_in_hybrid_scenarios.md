# Lab: Migrating Hyper-V VMs to Azure by using Azure Migrate

## Lab scenario

Despite its ambitions to modernize its workloads as part of the migration to Azure, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team realizes that, due to aggressive timelines, in many cases, it will be necessary to follow the lift-and-shift approach. To simplify this task, the team starts exploring the capabilities of Azure Migrate. Azure Migrate serves as a centralized hub to assess and migrate to Azure on-premises servers, infrastructure, applications, and data.

Azure Migrate provides the following features:

- Unified migration platform: A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.
- Range of tools: A range of tools for assessment and migration. Tools include Azure Migrate: Server Assessment and Migration and modernization. Azure Migrate integrates with other Azure services and with other tools and independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
- Assessment and migration: In the Azure Migrate hub, you can assess and migrate:
    - Servers: Assess on-premises servers and migrate them to Azure virtual machines.
    - Databases: Assess on-premises databases and migrate them to Azure SQL Database or to SQL Managed Instance.
    - Web applications: Assess on-premises web applications and migrate them to Azure App Service by using the Azure App Service Migration Assistant.
    - Virtual desktops: Assess your on-premises virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and migrate it to Windows Virtual Desktop in Azure.
    - Data: Migrate large amounts of data to Azure quickly and cost-effectively using Azure Data Box products.

While databases, web apps, and virtual desktops are within the scope of the next stage of the migration initiative, the Adatum Enterprise Architecture team wants to start by evaluating the use of Azure Migrate for migrating their on-premises Hyper-V virtual machines to Azure VM.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-801%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Migrating%20Hyper-V%20VMs%20to%20Azure%20by%20using%20Azure%20Migrate)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same. 

## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-  Prepare for assessment and migration by using Azure Migrate.
-  Assess Hyper-V for migration by using Azure Migrate.
-  Migrate Hyper-V VMs by using Azure Migrate.

## Estimated Time: 120 minutes

## Lab Environment
  
Virtual machines: **AZ-801T00A-SEA-DC1** and **AZ-801T00A-SEA-SVR2** must be running. Other VMs can be running, but they aren't required for this lab.

> **Note**: **AZ-801T00A-SEA-DC1** and **AZ-801T00A-SEA-SVR2** virtual machines are hosting the installation of **SEA-DC1** and **SEA-SVR2**

1. Select **SEA-SVR2**.
1. Sign in using the credentials provided by the instructor.

For this lab, you'll use the available VM environment and an Azure subscription. Before you begin the lab, ensure that you have an Azure subscription and a user account with the Owner role in that subscription.

## Exercise 1: Prepare the lab environment

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template.
1. Deploy Azure Bastion.
1. Deploy a nested VM in the Azure VM.

#### Task 1: Deploy an Azure VM by using an Azure Resource Manager QuickStart template

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, start Microsoft Edge, browse to the [301-nested-vms-in-virtual-network Azure QuickStart template](https://github.com/az140mp/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/demos/nested-vms-in-virtual-network) and select **Deploy to Azure**. (You find the button **Deploy to Azure** in the `README.md` file after the list of resources created by the template.)
1. When prompted, in the Azure portal, sign in by using the credentials of a user account with the Owner role in the subscription you'll be using in this lab.
1. On the **Hyper-V Host Virtual Machine with nested VMs** page in the Azure portal, perform a deployment with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
   | Resource group | the name of a new resource group **AZ801-L0701-RG** |
   | Region | the name of an Azure region into which you can provision Azure VMs |

   | Host Admin Username | **Student** |
   | Host Admin Password | **Pa55w.rd1234** |

   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment might take about 10 minutes.

#### Task 2: Deploy Azure Bastion 

> **Note**: Azure Bastion allows for connection to the Azure VMs without public endpoints which you deployed in the previous task of this exercise, while providing protection against brute force exploits that target operating system level credentials.

1. On **SEA-SVR2**, in the browser window displaying the Azure portal, open a PowerShell session on the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the PowerShell session on the **Cloud Shell** pane, run the following commands to add a subnet named **AzureBastionSubnet** to the virtual network named **az801l07a-hv-vnet** you created earlier in this exercise:

   ```powershell
   $resourceGroupName = 'AZ801-L0701-RG'
   $vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name 'az801l07a-hv-vnet'
   $subnetConfig = Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig `
    -Name 'AzureBastionSubnet' `
    -AddressPrefix 10.0.7.0/24 `
    -VirtualNetwork $vnet
   $vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
   ```

1. Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.
1. From the Azure portal, create an Azure Bastion instance with the following settings:

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab |
   | Resource group | **AZ801-L0701-RG** |
   | Name | **az801l07a-bastion** |
   | Region | the same Azure region to which you deployed the resources in the previous tasks of this exercise |
   | Tier | **Basic** |
   | Virtual network | **az801l07a-hv-vnet** |
   | Subnet | **AzureBastionSubnet (10.0.7.0/24)** |
   | Public IP address | **Create new** |
   | Public IP name | **az801l07a-hv-vnet-ip** |

   > **Note**: The bastion must be created in the same Azure region as the virtual network.
   
   > **Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next task. The deployment might take about 5 minutes.

#### Task 3: Deploy a nested VM in the Azure VM

1. In the Azure portal, browse to the **az801l07a-hv-vm** virtual machine page.
1. From the **az801l07a-hv-vm** page, connect to the operating system running within the virtual machine, via Azure Bastion, with the following credentials:

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | User Name |**Student** |
   | Password |**Pa55w.rd1234** |

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm**, in the **Server Manager** window, disable **IE Enhanced Security Configuration**.
1. Use File Explorer to create two folders **F:\\VHDs** and **F:\\VMs**.
1. Use Microsoft Edge to download the Windows Server 2022 **VHD** file from [Windows Server Evaluations](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-11/accessing-trials-and-kits-for-windows-eval-center-workaround/m-p/3361125) and copy it to the **F:\VHDs** folder. 
1. Use **Hyper-V Manager** to create a new virtual machine with the following settings:

   | Setting | Value | 
   | --- | --- |
   | Name | **az801l07a-vm1** | 
   | Store the virtual machine in a different location | selected | 
   | Location | **F:\VMs** |
   | Generation | **1** |
   | Memory | static set to **2048** MB |
   | Connection | **NestedSwitch** |
   | Virtual Hard Disk | the VHD file downloaded to the **F:\VHDs** folder |

1. Start the newly provisioned VM and connect to it by using the Virtual Machine Connection. 
1. In the **Virtual Machine Connection** window, initialize the operating system. 
1. Set the password of the built-in Administrator account to **Pa55w.rd**. 
1. In the **Virtual Machine Connection** window, sign in to **az801l07a-vm1**. 
1. Open a **Windows PowerShell** window and set the computer name to **az801l07a-vm1** by running:

   ```powershell

## Exercise 2: Prepare for assessment and migration by using Azure Migrate
  
The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure Hyper-V environment.
1. Create an Azure Migrate project.
1. Implement the target Azure environment.

#### Task 1: Configure Hyper-V environment

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm**, in the browser window, go to [https://aka.ms/migrate/script/hyperv](https://aka.ms/migrate/script/hyperv), and download the Azure Migrate configuration PowerShell script.

   >**Note**: The script performs the following tasks: 
   >- Checks that you're running the script on a supported PowerShell version
   >- Verifies that you have administrative privileges on the Hyper-V host
   >- Allows you to create a local user account that the Azure Migrate service uses to communicate with the Hyper-V host (This user account is added to **Remote Management Users**, **Hyper-V Administrators**, and **Performance Monitor Users** groups on the Hyper-V host.) 
   >- Checks that the host is running a supported version of Hyper-V and the Hyper-V role
   >- Enables the WinRM service and opens ports 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS) on the host (This is required for metadata collection.) 
   >- Enables PowerShell remoting on the host
   >- Checks that the Hyper-V Integration Services is enabled on all VMs managed by the host
   >- Enables CredSSP on the host if needed

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **az801l07a-hv-vm**, start **Windows PowerShell ISE**. 
1. In the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell ISE** window, run the following commands to copy the script to the **C:\\Labfiles\\Lab07** folder and remove the Zone.Identifier alternate data stream, which, in this case, indicates that the file was downloaded from the Internet:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path C:\Labfiles\Lab07 -Force
   Copy-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\MicrosoftAzureMigrate-Hyper-V.ps1" -Destination 'C:\Labfiles\Lab07'
